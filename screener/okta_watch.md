# Jesen Boey, Simon Piff(IDC), Brett (CSO APAC) - Identity-First is Business-First
- zero trust, multi-layered security 
- password (credential), multi-factor enabled -- what's the most servere ?
- digital trust - effective risk mitigation (https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US43986218)
- focus more on experience than security -- balance between user experience and corporate security by using SSO -- **seamless experience** -- no password for growth -- more flexibility with security 
- seamless access/authenticate - cookie-based/token-based authentication, social login where Okta makes it easy
- identity enterprise + CIAM - must be flexible enough
- **Trend** passwordless (reduce vs replace), cross-platform, risk profile (0 password based on application and access)
